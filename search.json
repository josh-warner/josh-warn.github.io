    "text": "In today’s College basketball realm, it takes a lot more than just talent to be good. It takes leadership, strategy, culture and standards. Many mental aspects of college basketball play a huge part in the game. For example, How can a team handle playing under pressure, how do they respond to adversity, and how do they let other environments, like playing on the road, affect them?  Now, who is the worst team on the road, and who is affected by home-court advantage the most? And what constitutes being the worst on the road? Playing on the road might be the biggest adversity that a team faces, so handling business on the road is essential to being successful. But, does a team being good on the road make them good overall? Does being terrible on the road make that team terrible overall? Statistically speaking, probably.  \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nlogs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs19.csv\")\nlogs20 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs20.csv\")\nlogs22 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs22.csv\")\nlogs23 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs23.csv\")\nlogs24 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/logs24.csv\")\n\n\nthelogs23 &lt;- logs23 |&gt;\n  mutate(TeamFull = case_when(TeamFull == \"Sam Houston State Bearkats\" ~ \"Sam Houston Bearkats\", TRUE ~ TeamFull))\n\n\nlogscombo &lt;- bind_rows(logs19, logs20, logs22, thelogs23, logs24)\n\nthelogscombo &lt;- logscombo |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(TeamScore) == FALSE)\n\nReallogscombo &lt;- thelogscombo \n\nhomegames &lt;- Reallogscombo |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(HomeAway) == TRUE)\n\nHomeCombo &lt;- homegames |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totalpts = sum(TeamScore),\n    totalallowed = sum(OpponentScore),\n    totalgames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Scoringmargin = totalpts-totalallowed,\n     AvgPtsMargin = Scoringmargin / totalgames\n  )|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgPtsMargin))\n\nawaygames &lt;- Reallogscombo |&gt;\n  filter(HomeAway == \"@\")\n\nAwayCombo &lt;- awaygames |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totalpts = sum(TeamScore),\n    totalallowed = sum(OpponentScore),\n    totalgames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Scoringmargin = totalpts-totalallowed,\n     AvgPtsMargin = Scoringmargin / totalgames\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgPtsMargin))\n\nawayjoin &lt;- AwayCombo |&gt; select(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin) |&gt; rename(AwayAvgPtsMargin = AvgPtsMargin)\n\nhomejoin &lt;- HomeCombo |&gt; select(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin) |&gt; rename(HomeAvgPtsMargin = AvgPtsMargin)\n\nmarginjoined &lt;- homejoin |&gt; inner_join(awayjoin)\n\n\nFullCombo &lt;- Reallogscombo |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totalpts = sum(TeamScore),\n    totalallowed = sum(OpponentScore),\n    totalgames = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Scoringmargin = totalpts-totalallowed,\n     AvgPtsMargin = Scoringmargin / totalgames\n  )|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgPtsMargin))\n\n\nCourtmargin &lt;- marginjoined |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Homeawaymargin = HomeAvgPtsMargin-AwayAvgPtsMargin\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Homeawaymargin))\n\nFilterHighFullCombo &lt;- FullCombo |&gt; filter(AvgPtsMargin &gt; 11.0)\nFilterHighAwayCombo &lt;- AwayCombo |&gt; filter(AvgPtsMargin &gt; 5.5)\nFilterLowFullCombo &lt;- FullCombo |&gt; filter(AvgPtsMargin &lt; -9.0)\nFilterLowAwayCombo &lt;- AwayCombo |&gt; filter(AvgPtsMargin &lt; -15.06)\nFilterCourtmargin &lt;- Courtmargin |&gt; filter(Homeawaymargin &gt; 21.5)\nFilterZag &lt;- FilterHighFullCombo |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"Gonzaga Bulldogs\")\nFilterlib &lt;- FilterHighFullCombo |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"Liberty Flames\")\nFilterZagAway &lt;- FilterHighAwayCombo |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"Gonzaga Bulldogs\")\nFilterMVSU &lt;- FilterLowFullCombo |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils\")\nFilterMVSUAway &lt;- FilterLowAwayCombo |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils\")\nFilterNCC &lt;- FilterCourtmargin |&gt; filter(TeamFull == \"North Carolina Central Eagles\") \nvectormargin &lt;- c(\"North Carolina Central Eagles\", \"Norfolk State Spartans\", \"Le Moyne Dolphins\", \"Southern Jaguars\", \"Morgan State Bears\")\nFiltermarginjoined &lt;- marginjoined |&gt; filter(TeamFull %in% vectormargin)\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(data=FilterHighFullCombo, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FilterZag, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"navy\") +\n  geom_bar(data=Filterlib, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), color = \"red\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average Points Margin\", \n    title=\"Best Teams based on Average Points Margin\", \n    subtitle=\"Liberty suprisingly stands among a group of College Basketball Bluebloods .\", \n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Josh Warner\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixing every game played in the past 5 years (18-19 to 23-24, excluding the 2020-21 season due to COVID limiting attendance), it seems as though the best teams in overall point margin are pretty predictable, besides Liberty. Gonzaga, Houston, Duke, and Arizona have been a few of the blue bloods of Men’s Basketball for the past 5-6 years, so it’s no shocker that they lead the country in Average Points Margin over the past 5 ACTUAL seasons of College Basketball. Now, how do these teams fair when on the road?\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\ngeom_bar(data=FilterHighAwayCombo, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=FilterZagAway, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"navy\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average Points Margin\", \n    title=\"Best Teams based on Average Points Margin on the road\", \n    subtitle=\"Not suprisingly, majority of the best teams in overall points margin are the best in points margin on the road.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Josh Warner\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey do pretty well, actually. Only two teams from the previous graph are not in the top 5 for the Average Away Game Scoring Margin, and those two are Arizona and Liberty, unsurprisingly. So, the Great teams are good on the road, but does that mean the Teams that are bad on the road are Dogshit?\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\ngeom_bar(data=FilterLowAwayCombo, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n geom_bar(data=FilterMVSUAway, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"forestgreen\") + \n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average Points Margin\", \n    title=\"Worst Teams based on Average Points Margin on the road\", \n    subtitle=\"Unsurprisingly, there is almost no difference between the worst overall and worst road teams.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Josh Warner\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot()+\ngeom_bar(data=FilterLowFullCombo, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\ngeom_bar(data=FilterMVSU, aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgPtsMargin), weight=AvgPtsMargin), fill = \"forestgreen\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average Points Margin\", \n    title=\"Worst Teams based on Average Points Margin\", \n    subtitle=\"Mississippi Valley State Delta is in a league of their own when it comes to poor basketball play.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Matt Waite | By Josh Warner\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the charts, Yeah. The worst-performing teams on the road are also the worst-performing teams overall. Using The same game log data, it looks like Mississippi Valley State Delta is the shittiest team on the road by quite a lot, and then when using the same metric for every game instead of only Away games, they are still by far the worst team overall. But it’s not just MVSDU. 4 of the 5 Worst performing teams on the road are also the Top 5 in the lowest Average scoring margin in all games. So yes, being good on the road most likely means that a team is good and vice versa. But just because a dogshit team is bad on the road doesn’t mean they are the actual worst team on the road. In order to actually be the worst team on the road, you have to be good at home. Let me explain.\nBeing chronically affected by home-court advantage can make a mediocre team play complete shit on the road. Now we know of schools with huge fanbases, like Duke, Kansas, and North Carolina, that make beating those teams on the road a herculean task. But almost all of those teams are good enough to win on the road without their fans. They’re good teams; that’s why they have that fanbase. But who is the worst team on the road compared to their home performances?\n\n\nCode\nFilterCourtmargin |&gt;\n  ungroup()|&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Homeawaymargin)) |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, Homeawaymargin) |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  cols_label(\n    TeamFull = \"Team\",\n    Homeawaymargin = \"Home Away PTS Margin\")  |&gt;\ntab_header(\n    title=\"Biggest Margin between Home and Away performance\", \n    subtitle=\"NC Central takes the cake for the biggest Homecourt team in College Basketball\"\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Josh Warner  |  **Source:** Matt Waite\"))|&gt;\n   tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"#000000\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  )|&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=14)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#880023\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = TeamFull == \"North Carolina Central Eagles\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiggest Margin between Home and Away performance\n\n\nNC Central takes the cake for the biggest Homecourt team in College Basketball\n\n\nTeam\nHome Away PTS Margin\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina Central Eagles\n29.97815\n\n\nNorfolk State Spartans\n25.35157\n\n\nLe Moyne Dolphins\n24.65992\n\n\nSouthern Jaguars\n23.76462\n\n\nMorgan State Bears\n21.85516\n\n\n\nBy: Josh Warner | Source: Matt Waite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=Filtermarginjoined, \n    aes(y=reorder(TeamFull, HomeAvgPtsMargin), x=HomeAvgPtsMargin, xend=AwayAvgPtsMargin),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n     x=\"Home and Away Scoring Margins\", \n    y=\"Team\", \n    title=\"Home and Away Average Points Margin\", \n    subtitle = \"The Average Home Points Margin is green.

The Eagles have a huge advantage at home. Their Home game scoring margin is almost 30 POINTS HIGHER than their Away game scoring margin. The table shows this debate is not even close, as the Eagles Home-Away Margin is almost 5 points higher than the second-place Norfolk State Spartans. The bottom chart shows just how Bipolar NC Central is when playing on the road. Step Aside Kansas and Duke, and hell, The 2023-24 Nebraska Cornhuskers. There is a new king of the Home Court advantage, the North Carolina Central Eagles."

    "section": "",
    "text": "For the past two decades, Nebraska Football fans have suffered severely from mediocre football play. In 2017 fans thought they had found their savior in Coach Scott Frost. The hype surrounding him is what further led to the suffering of fans when the results were very much subpar compared to the expectations. But why? Could it be that Coach Frost is a bad coach? Probably not because UCF was very successful under him. So then what is the explanation of their failure to win? If you ask Coach Osborne and most casual fans, they’ll tell you it’s the 4th quarter. “if you looked at the score at the end of three quarters, Scott would have had a really good record.” Osborne said. Now is this true? If the 4th quarter was eliminated, how would the Husker’s perform under Frost? Would they finally make the coveted bowl game? Would Scott Frost have a Job still? How much different would Husker Football be?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(gt) \nlibrary(ggalt) \nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nlogs18 &lt;- read_csv(\"3q 2018.csv\") \nlogs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"3q 2019.csv\") \nlogs20 &lt;- read_csv(\"3q 2020.csv\") \nlogs21 &lt;- read_csv(\"3q 2021.csv\") \nlogs22 &lt;- read_csv(\"3q 2022.csv\") \ntotals &lt;- read_csv(\"Frost 3q.csv\")\n\nQ18 &lt;- logs18 |&gt; mutate( PointsMargin = ThrQPTS - ThrQOppPTS, TotalMargin = sum(PointsMargin), meanMarg = TotalMargin/12, AvgMarg = meanMarg/10)|&gt;\n  select(Season, AvgMarg)\n\nQ19&lt;- logs19 |&gt; mutate( PointsMargin = ThrQPTS - ThrQOppPTS, TotalMargin = sum(PointsMargin), \nmeanMarg = TotalMargin/12, \nAvgMarg = meanMarg/10)|&gt;\n  select(Season, AvgMarg)\n\nQ20 &lt;- logs20 |&gt; mutate( PointsMargin = ThrQPTS - ThrQOppPTS, TotalMargin = sum(PointsMargin), \nmeanMarg = TotalMargin/12, \nAvgMarg = meanMarg/10)|&gt;\n  select(Season, AvgMarg)\n\nQ21 &lt;- logs21 |&gt; mutate( PointsMargin = ThrQPTS - ThrQOppPTS, TotalMargin = sum(PointsMargin), \nmeanMarg = TotalMargin/12, \nAvgMarg = meanMarg/10)|&gt;\n  select(Season, AvgMarg)\n\n                            \nQ22 &lt;- logs22 |&gt; mutate( PointsMargin = ThrQPTS - ThrQOppPTS, TotalMargin = sum(PointsMargin), \nmeanMarg = TotalMargin/12, \nAvgMarg = meanMarg/10)|&gt;\n  select(Season, AvgMarg)\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=totals, \n    aes(y=reorder(Season, Season), x=Wins, xend=ActWins),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"black\") +\n   labs(\n     x=\"Actual Wins and 3rd Quarter Wins\", \n    y=\"Season\", \n    title=\"The Frost era see's very little change\", \n    subtitle = \"The amount of 3rd Quarter wins are red.

Now would the Huskers make a bowl game this season if the 4th quarter didn’t exist? Potentially, they would definitely be invited. The only 5-7 team in a bowl game that year was Rutgers who played against No. 17 Wake Forest in a 38-10 loss. Rutgers was the replacement for Texas A&M who couldn’t compete due to COVID. Now in this scenario Rutgers would only have 4 wins to Nebraska’s 5 so ultimately Nebraska would have invited as the replacement team, but we’ll never know if the Husker’s would accept.\nNow going back to the whole three quarters thing. Coach Osborne was very much incorrect in his statement, which is surprising for someone who is such a mastermind. You would think he would’ve actually looked at the stats before saying this. Sorry Husker fans, even in a fantasy scenario the Sker’s still can’t win."
